1>Given an array of n positive elements, where all the numbers occurs even number of time except one which occur odd
number of time, find that number.

Xor all the elements, result will be the number occurring odd number of times.


2>Given an array of size n, all the elements are in range (1 to n) and occur only once except 2 numbers which occurs
twice.Find those numbers

Solution1:- using counting technique

Solution2:- using XOR.

Solution2:- using formula:-
Let the numbers be X and Y.
X + Y = (sum of n natural numbers) - sum of all the elements in the array.
X*Y= (product of n natural numbers=n!)/product of all the elements in the array.
