An undirected graph is called Biconnected if there are two vertex-disjoint paths between any two vertices. In a Biconnected Graph, there is a simple cycle through any two vertices.
By convention, two nodes connected by an edge form a biconnected graph, but this does not verify the above properties. For a graph with more than two vertices,
the above properties must be there for it to be Biconnected.

A connected graph is Biconnected if it is connected and doesnâ€™t have any Articulation Point. We mainly need to check two things in a graph.
1) The graph is connected.
2) There is not articulation point in graph.
