Given an array of n integers. Write a program to find minimum number of changes in array so that array is strictly
increasing.

The numbers which are already a part of LIS need not to be changed.
So minimum elements to change is difference of size of array and number of elements in LIS.
Min Opeartion required = Array.length - LIS
