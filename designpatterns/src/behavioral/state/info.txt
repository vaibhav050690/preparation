1>State design pattern is used when an Object change its behavior based on its internal state ie same
action can perform different task based on its current state.
2>If we have to change the behavior of an object based on its state, one way of doing that is we can have a
state variable in the Object an then use if-else condition block to perform different actions based on the
state. There will be lot of if and else blocks if we have many state to which an object can go from its current
state.
State design pattern is used to provide a systematic and loosely coupled way to achieve this through Context
and State implementations.
3>Participants in uml:-
1>Context:- Defines an interface to client to interact. It maintains references to concrete state object
  which may be used to define current state of object.
2>State: Defines interface for declaring what each concrete state should do.(defines methods for all the actions)
3> ConcreteState: Provides implementation for methods defined in State.

4>Example:- Consider the StateDiagram.jpg. It shows the state diagram for entry gates in metro station.
it has following actions:-
1>SwipeCardSuccess
2>SwipeCardFailed
3>UserEnters

and has 2 states:-
1>Gate Open
2>Gate closed

The state diagram shows the transition of one state to another upon various actions.One way of modelling this
would be to have to variables current state and action and have if else block in the your code to handle
all the possible combination ie
if(currentSate = "open"){
    if(action = "userEnters"){
        currentState = "closed";
    }
    else if("SwipeCardSuccess"){
    ....
}

This code is very tightly coupled with client code.If tomorrow you want to add a new state, it requires another
block in your if else condition but with State design pattern, you just need to create the new state which
implements the State interface and define its functionality and call it from your gate context class,

This Code will also have a lot of if else blocks. We can easily model this problem using state design pattern.

5>Used in java api:-
Container code in web servers which mainatins the life cycle of applications.
