/*
The traditional way to achieve thread synchronization in Java is by the use of synchronized keyword.
While it provides a certain basic synchronization, the synchronized keyword is quite rigid in its use.
For example, a thread can take a lock only once. Synchronized blocks donâ€™t offer any mechanism of a
waiting queue and after the exit of one thread, any thread can take the lock. This could lead to
starvation of resources for some other thread for a very long period of time.

Reentrant Locks are provided in Java to provide synchronization with greater flexibility.

What are Reentrant Locks?
The ReentrantLock class implements the Lock interface and provides synchronization to methods while
accessing shared resources. The code which manipulates the shared resource is surrounded by calls to lock
and unlock method. This gives a lock to the current working thread and blocks all other threads which are
trying to take a lock on the shared resource.

ReentrantLock allow threads to enter into lock on a resource more than once. When the thread first enters
into lock, a hold count is set to one. Before unlocking the thread can re-enter into lock again and every
time hold count is incremented by one. For every unlock request, hold count is decremented by one and
when hold count is 0, the resource is unlocked.

Reentrant Locks also offer a fairness parameter, by which the lock would abide by the order of the lock
request i.e. after a thread unlocks the resource, the lock would go to the thread which has been waiting
for the longest time. This fairness mode is set up by passing true to the constructor of the lock.

ReentrantLock Methods

lock(): Call to the lock() method increments the hold count by 1 and gives the lock to the thread if the
shared resource is initially free.

unlock(): Call to the unlock() method decrements the hold count by 1. When this count reaches zero,
the resource is released.

tryLock(): If the resource is not held by any other thread, then call to tryLock() returns true and the
hold count is incremented by one. If the resource is not free then the method returns false and the
thread is not blocked but it exits.

tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit): As per the method, the thread waits for a certain time period as
defined by arguments of the method to acquire the lock on the resource before exiting.

lockInterruptibly(): This method acquires the lock if the resource is free while allowing for the thread
to be interrupted by some other thread while acquiring the resource. It means that if the current thread is
waiting for lock but some other thread requests the lock, then the current thread will be interrupted and
return immediately without acquiring lock.

getHoldCount(): This method returns the count of the number of locks held on the resource.
isHeldByCurrentThread(): This method returns true if the lock on the resource is held by the current thread.
